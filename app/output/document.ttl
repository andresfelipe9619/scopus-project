        bibo:abstract                "Grounded and embodied theories of cognition suggest that both language and the body play crucial roles in grounding higher-order thought. This paper investigates how particular forms of speech and gesture function together to support abstract thought in mathematical proof construction. We use computerized text analysis software to evaluate how speech patterns support valid proof construction for two different tasks, and we use gesture analysis to investigate how dynamic gestures—those gestures that depict and transform mathematical objects—further support proof practices above and beyond speech patterns. We also evaluate the degree to which speech and gesture convey distinct information about mathematical reasoning during proving. Dynamic gestures and speech indicating logical inference support valid proof construction, and both dynamic gestures and speech uniquely predict variance in valid proof construction. Thus, dynamic gestures and speech each make separate and important contributions to the formulation of mathematical arguments, and both modalities can convey elements of students’ understanding to teachers and researchers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc." ;

The scale is one of larger patterns emerging from an ensemble mass, possibly through some type of energy equation and a reduction procedure. The links between the patterns can be formed naturally, as a residual effect of the pattern creation itself. This paper follows-on closely from the earlier research, including two earlier papers in the series and uses the ideas of entropy and cohesion. With a small addition, it is possible to show how the inter-pattern links can be determined. A compact Grid form of an earlier Counting Mechanism is also demonstrated and may be a new clustering technique. It is possible to explain how a very basic repeating structure can form the arbitrary patterns and activation sequences between them, and a key question of how nodes synchronise may even be answerable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V." ;

        bibo:abstract                "CORTEX is a cognitive robotics architecture inspired by three key ideas: modularity, internal modelling and graph representations. CORTEX is also a computational framework designed to support early forms of intelligence in real world, human interacting robots, by selecting an a priori functional decomposition of the capabilities of the robot. This set of abilities was then translated to computational modules or agents, each one built as a network of software interconnected components. The nature of these agents can range from pure reactive modules connected to sensors and/or actuators, to pure deliberative ones, but they can only communicate with each other through a graph structure called Deep State Representation (DSR). DSR is a short-term dynamic representation of the space surrounding the robot, the objects and the humans in it, and the robot itself. All these entities are perceived and transformed into different levels of abstraction, ranging from geometric data to high-level symbolic relations such as “the person is talking and gazing at me”. The combination of symbolic and geometric information endows the architecture with the potential to simulate and anticipate the outcome of the actions executed by the robot. In this paper we present recent advances in the CORTEX architecture and several real-world human-robot interaction scenarios in which they have been tested. We describe our interpretation of the ideas inspiring the architecture and the reasons why this specific computational framework is a promising architecture for the social robots of tomorrow. © 2019 Elsevier B.V." ;

The participants were 109 seventh-grade students who were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, forming a 2 × 2 factorial design, with the presence or absence of an instructional video as one factor and collaboration as the other. With regard to learning achievement, the findings revealed a significant main interaction effect between the use of an instructional video and collaboration. While collaborative DGBL promoted intrinsic motivation, the results for cognitive load showed that the use of an instructional video in collaborative DGBL significantly reduced both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads. The implications for designing game-based science learning are discussed. © 2019" ;

We designed experiments to demonstrate that the trained vectors, obtained from a balanced domain corpus, are better than using pre-trained word embeddings. We also present some experiments to show that different combinations of both word embeddings spaces increase the overall accuracy of the retrieval task compared to using only the pre-trained vectors. However an issue arised when both embeddings spaces are not sharing the same dimensions and terms, as shown in our case. In order to handle this situation, we suggest to use a method to reduce dimensions of pre-trained vectors (e.g. PCA), and combine them with our trained vectors. This improves the accuracy of the retrieval task for unseen CVs. Our main contribution is to create a model that detects which embeddings need to be used in order to maximize the relevant retrieval results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd" ;

        bibo:abstract                "One of the biggest stakes in nanoelectronics today is to meet the needs of Artificial Intelligence by designing hardware neural networks which, by fusing computation and memory, process and learn from data with limited energy. For this purpose, memristive devices are excellent candidates to emulate synapses. A challenge, however, is to map existing learning algorithms onto a chip: for a physical implementation, a learning rule should ideally be tolerant to the typical intrinsic imperfections of such memristive devices, and local. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), for their local learning rule and inherent tolerance to stochasticity, comply with both of these constraints and constitute a highly attractive algorithm towards achieving memristor-based Deep Learning. On simulation grounds, this work gives insights into designing simple memristive devices programming protocols to train on chip Boltzmann Machines. Among other RBM-based neural networks, we advocate using a Discriminative RBM, with two hardware-oriented adaptations. We propose a pulse width selection scheme based on the sign of two successive weight updates, and show that it removes the constraint to precisely tune the initial programming pulse width as a hyperparameter. We also propose to evaluate the weight update requested by the algorithm across several samples and stochastic realizations. We show that this strategy brings a partial immunity against the most severe memristive device imperfections such as the non-linearity and the stochasticity of the conductance updates, as well as device-to-device variability. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        bibo:abstract                "Recent advances in neurosciences and cognitive sciences show us that the human neocortex is not a slave to the experiences from our perception and that the memories stored in hippocampus are goal weighted during the replay of the experiences for the purpose of re-learning from them. Temporal difference reinforcement learning systems that use neural networks as function approximators rely on an experience replay memory structure similar to the hippocampus. We bring forward this similarity and present a novel way of using a goal weighted prioritization of the memory that is biologically inspired. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prioritization criteria called Variety of Experience Index, or VEI, for weighting the selection of the experiences that are stored in the replay memory. Weighting the experiences based on two different extremes of VEI can behaviourally modify the agent's learning process, generating different types of learning agents that exhibit different personality traits along the dimension of Openness to Experience. © 2019 Elsevier B.V." ;

        bibo:abstract                "Western musical styles use a large variety of chords and vertical sonorities. Based on objective acoustical properties, chords can be situated on a dissonant-consonant continuum. While this might to some extent converge with the unpleasant-pleasant continuum, subjective liking might diverge for various chord forms from music across different styles. Our study aimed to investigate how well appraisals of the roughness and pleasantness dimensions of isolated chords taken from real-world music are predicted by Parncutt’s established model of sensory dissonance. Furthermore, we related these subjective ratings to style of origin and acoustical features of the chords as well as musical sophistication of the raters. Ratings were obtained for chords deemed representative of the harmonic language of three different musical styles (classical, jazz and avant-garde music), plus randomly generated chords. Results indicate that pleasantness and roughness ratings were, on average, mirror opposites; however, their relative distribution differed greatly across styles, reflecting different underlying aesthetic ideals. Parncutt’s model only weakly predicted ratings for all but Classical chords, suggesting that listeners’ appraisal of the dissonance and pleasantness of chords bears not only on stimulus-side but also on listener-side factors. Indeed, we found that levels of musical sophistication negatively predicted listeners’ tendency to rate the consonance and pleasantness of any one chord as coupled measures, suggesting that musical education and expertise may serve to individuate how these musical dimensions are apprehended. © 2019, The Author(s)." ;

        bibo:abstract                "There is a paucity of information about how human hippocampal subfields are functionally connected to each other and to neighbouring extra-hippocampal cortices. In particular, little is known about whether patterns of functional connectivity (FC) differ down the anterior-posterior axis of each subfield. Here, using high resolution structural MRI we delineated the hippocampal subfields in healthy young adults. This included the CA fields, separating DG/CA4 from CA3, separating the pre/parasubiculum from the subiculum, and also segmenting the uncus. We then used high resolution resting state functional MRI to interrogate FC. We first analysed the FC of each hippocampal subfield in its entirety, in terms of FC with other subfields and with the neighbouring regions, namely entorhinal, perirhinal, posterior parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices. Next, we analysed FC for different portions of each hippocampal subfield along its anterior-posterior axis, in terms of FC between different parts of a subfield, FC with other subfield portions, and FC of each subfield portion with the neighbouring cortical regions of interest. We found that intrinsic functional connectivity between the subfields aligned generally with the tri-synaptic circuit but also extended beyond it. Our findings also revealed that patterns of functional connectivity between the subfields and neighbouring cortical areas differed markedly along the anterior-posterior axis of each hippocampal subfield. Overall, these results contribute to ongoing efforts to characterise human hippocampal subfield connectivity, with implications for understanding hippocampal function. © 2019 The Authors" ;

        bibo:abstract                "Objective: To examine associations between internalizing symptoms and self-reported aberrant driving behaviors in a large sample (n = 341) of older adults (mean age = 62.6 years, SD = 4.8). Design: Cross-sectional survey. Results: Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater symptoms of emotional distress (i.e., higher scores on the Expanded Version of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS-II) emotional distress composite) were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors (i.e., higher scores on the Driving Behavior Questionnaire). In contrast, neither obsessions/fears nor emotional well-being were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors. Follow-up regression analyses examining specific IDAS-II subscales revealed that greater suicidality, appetite gain, appetite loss, panic, and ill temper were associated with greater aberrant driving behaviors. Individuals reporting greater suicidality and appetite loss reported greater tendencies to unintentionally commit errors behind the wheel, while individuals reporting greater ill temper and appetite loss reported greater tendencies to intentionally engage in unsafe driving behaviors that may put other drivers in harm's way. Conclusion: Older adults reporting emotional distress may be at risk for engaging in aberrant driving behaviors. In particular, certain symptoms of emotional distress (e.g., suicidality, ill temper) are tied to higher rates of aberrant driving behaviors within this population. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd" ;

        bibo:abstract                "A computational model is created to simulate drivers’ task switching behavior, or dynamic allocation of visual attention, while they are driving and engaging in a secondary task. The model takes the following into account: uncertainty about the roadway, task structure, and individual differences. The first factor, uncertainty, means a lack of information about the roadway that plays a significant role in switching attention back to the roadway. The second factor, task structure, reflects the driver's tendency to switch visual attention from the secondary task to the roadway at subtask boundaries as well as the tendency to continue to perform task to reach subtask boundaries. Lastly, the model considers the variability of performance speed across the driver population. The factors jointly influence the probability of switching attention in the model. We use the ABC-MCMC (Approximate Bayesian Computation – Markov Chain Monte Carlo) method to estimate model parameters that produce the microstructure of task switching. The fitted model generates glance patterns at a micro level that are consistent with those generated by participants in an experiment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd" ;

However, this significant innovation does not entirely eliminate the need for the presence of human operators; on the contrary, it requires them to collaborate with robots and execute hybrid tasks. Thus, creating safe workspaces for human operators is crucial for the future of factories where humans and robots collaborate closely in common workspaces. The uncertainty of human behavior and, consequently, of the actual execution of workflows, pose significant challenges to the safety of collaborative applications. This paper extends our earlier work, a formal verification methodology to analyze the safety of collaborative robotics applications (Askarpour et al. 2017) [1], with a rich non-deterministic formal model of operator behaviors that captures the hazardous situations resulting from human errors. The model allows safety engineers to refine their designs until all plausible erroneous behaviors are considered and mitigated. The solidity of the proposed approach is evaluated on a pair of real-life case studies. © 2019" ;
